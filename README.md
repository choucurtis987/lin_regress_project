## Predicting a Car's MPG based on Weight
- In this project, I created my own linear regression model and used it to build a model
that will predict a car's mpg based on its weight
- The linear regression model finds the best fit line of the dataset and makes predictions based off of it
- [scrappy_linreg.py](/lin_regress_project/scrappy_linreg.py) also ultilizes a R squared function where one could find the R squared value of the line

## Future directions
- Build a model that can more accurately model unknown data 
- Finding a way to use the model with uneven X and Y's (more info in "scrappy_linreg.py").
